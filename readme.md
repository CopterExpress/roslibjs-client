Roslibjs Client
====

This is a wrapper around the roslibjs package aiming to improve shortcomings of the original roslib package by introducing a fluent API as well as some useful error and fault handling mechanisms.

For the official roslibjs repository please head to [https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs)

### Main Features

* Fluent API
* Automatic connection recovery
* Reconnect support for topics

### Use at your own risk

We neither encourage nor discourage the use of this package in your projects. However, this is just a simple wrapper we created for our own needs. Bug reports and suggestions pertaining to this particular client library are quite welcome, but we will not respond to feature requests for your own use case or bug reports that are related to the roslibjs itself. Bear in mind that you can always use Roslibjs without this package, since this package itself is a wrapper around it.
